{
    
    "first_page_url" : "It contain the url of first page",
    
    "last_page_url" : "It contain the url of last page",

    "prev_page_url" : "It contain the url for prev page",
    
    "total" : "It contain the total number of records",
    
    "current_page" : "It contain the current page number",
    
    "data" : "It contain the record for the current page"

}
